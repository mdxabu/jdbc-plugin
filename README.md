## Overview

`jdbc-plugin` is a lightweight Java library that provides a wrapper around various JDBC drivers, including AWS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more.

- **Multi-Database Support**: Easily switch between different databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- **Connection Pooling**: Built-in support for connection pooling to optimize resource usage.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and logging capabilities.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Built-in support for asynchronous database operations.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add support for additional JDBC drivers as needed.
